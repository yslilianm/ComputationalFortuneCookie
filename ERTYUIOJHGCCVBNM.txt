 -----------------Computational Fortune Cookie (CFC)-----------------
Treat yourself to a little break and a computational fortune cookie!

The new year approaching is a good time for personal reflection, meditation 
and a time to plan new possibilities for our well being as well as dreams. 

This app is an opportunity for you to take 15min off, 
disconnect of others and connect to yourself and your dreams. 

Reflect and write a little on the questions to follow, 
then take a deep breath and enjoy your unique cookie.

You may view and print your unique cookie representation 
which was computationally generated based on your own words and thoughts.

Happy New Year!
Lilian and Paola
